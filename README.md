# ReversiGame

Welcome to **ReversiGame**, a feature-rich implementation of the classic Reversi game, designed for both casual players and developers who are interested in exploring C++ game development.

---

## **Overview**
ReversiGame is a C++ console-based application that offers an engaging gaming experience for two players. This project not only demonstrates game logic and player interaction but also implements intelligent move validation, dynamic score calculation, and an interactive user interface in the terminal.

---

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Board Size**: Supports various board sizes to enhance gameplay flexibility.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Designed for competitive play between two players.
- **Move Validation**: Ensures all moves are valid based on the rules of Reversi.
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time calculation and display of scores for both players.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear and concise prompts make the game accessible for all.

## **Gameplay Instructions**
1. The game begins with a dynamically created board.
2. Player 1 (`X`) and Player 2 (`O`) take turns.
3. Each player must choose a valid position on the board to place their marker.
4. The game follows the traditional Reversi rules:
   - Flipping opponent pieces between your pieces.
   - Valid moves must result in at least one opponent piece being flipped.
5. The game ends when no more valid moves are available for either player.
